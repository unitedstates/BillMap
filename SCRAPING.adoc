## Overview

There are a number of scrapers that get data for this project. The initial scraping, in some cases is done manually, and the data is then loaded into the database. There are Celery tasks that maintain the data. These are described in <<UPDATES_CELERY.adoc#, UPDATES_CELERY>>. 

The following scrapers are available:

1. US Congress (for bills and metadata)
2. Statements of Administration Policy
3. CRS reports
4. Relevant Committee Documents
5. CBO Scores

## Scrapers

### US Congress (Bills)

```bash
./run govinfo --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS
./run bills
```

When running initially, I got an error because the bulk directories had not been made. To unzip the files manually in all directories:

`find . -name "*.zip" | xargs -P 5 -I fileName sh -c 'unzip -o -d "$(dirname "fileName")/$(basename -s .zip "fileName")" "fileName"'`

For more detail, see <<USCONGRESS_SCRAPER.adoc#, USCONGRESS_SCRAPER>>.

### Statements of Administration Policy

Instructions for loading the database fixture for the Statements of Administration Policy are in the `DATA BACKGROUND` document, here: <<DATA_BACKGROUND#_statement_of_administration_policy, DATA BACKGROUND: Statement of Administration Policy>>.

To load the latest data (from the Biden Administration), run:

```bash

./manage.py biden_statements

```

### CRS Reports

The scraper for CRS Reports, and its instructions, are described in <<CRS_REPORTS.adoc#, CRS_REPORTS_SCRAPER>>.

### Relevant Committee Documents

To load Relevant Committee Documents data use the following instructions:


1. After installing the requirements under scrapers directory, run crec_scrape_urls.py file under scrapers directory.
2. Go to the crec_scrapy folder and run “scrapy crawl crec”  command. It will take about an hour to scrape all the data in crec_scrapy/data/crec_data.json file.
3. Copy scraped data from crec_scrapy/data/crec_data.json to django base directory. First delete old data under django base directory or replace it.
4. Run django command “./manage.py load_crec” command to populate the data to the database.

### CBO Scores

The CBO task processes metadata from the bill status files that are downloaded by the `unitedstates/congress` scraper (above). It finds the field 'cboCostEstimates' and collects these for all bills. Then, it stores any new scores in the database.


#### Install `unitedstates/congress` repository

The text of bills can be scraped with the Python project here: `https://github.com/unitedstates/congress`. First, clone this repository as a child of the `FlatGovDir` directory above, and a sibling of `congress`. In this way, running the scraper will fill out the text data within the `congress` directory.

```
$ cd /path/to/FlatGovDir
$ git clone https://github.com/unitedstates/congress.git
(no credentials needed-- it is an open repo)
```

#### Install scraper dependencies

Install the `congress` Python virtual environment, install the requirements (`pip install requirements.txt`). The scrapers were built with Python 2.7 and have not been upgraded; updates may be needed for a production environment, but the `@unitedstates/congress` scraper is sufficient to gather the baseline data to test the utilities in this repository.

NOTE: Scraping the initial data can be *very* time-consuming (most of a day, depending on your internet download speeds). To get started, it is worth finding a source for bulk downloads of the text, if possible.

On MacOS (Catalina), installing the `congress` requirements involved a few adjustments:

1. Install OpenSSL 1.02 with Homebrew. The latest OpenSSL (>1.1) causes problems with certain requirements; unfortunately, version 1.0.0 also failed. A script was set up by a Github user to install version 1.0.2.

`brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies; brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies; brew uninstall libressl --ignore-dependencies; brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/8b9d6d688f483a0f33fcfc93d433de501b9c3513/Formula/openssl.rb;`

2. Link the OpenSSL libraries

```
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

3. Install `pytz`, `pep517` and `cryptography` directly

```bash
pip install pytz
pip install pep517
pip install cryptography
```

4. Install requirements

From the `congress` repository directory, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
