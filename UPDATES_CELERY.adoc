## BillMap Celery Tasks: What they do.

Celery runs scheduled tasks, primarily to scrape and process data. To run celery, install Redis (as a taskrunner and db for Celery). The other dependencies are installed with `pip` when initially installing the requirements for the app with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

uscongress:: update uscongress bill and metadata
statementAdminPolicy:: updates statements of administration policy from the current White House (OMB) website
committeereport:: update committee reports associated with bills 
cbo:: update cbo reports associated with bills 
crs:: update crs reports associated with bills 

The main celery app is in `server_py/flatgov/flatgov/celery.py` and the schedule of tasks is defined in `app.conf.beat_schedule` there. Logs for celery tasks are stored in `/var/log/celery`, e.g.  /var/log/celery/link_celery.log`,  `/var/log/celery/link_celery-2.log`,  `/var/log/celery/link_celery-3.log` etc.

### US Congress Task

Within the US Congress task, there are six celery tasks, that run sequentially:
`update_bill_task`, `bill_data_task`, `process_bill_meta_task`, `related_bill_task`, `elastic_load_task`, `bill_similarity_task`

1. Download uscongress bill and metadata using sitemaps to efficiently determine what needs to be updated.

With the open source scraper itself, we run `./run govinfo --collections=BILLS --congress=117 --extract=mods,xml,premis --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS`

Then `./run bills`

It will create `data.json` out of `data.xml` and text_versions.

Instead of open source scraper command, we are using celery task named `update_bill_task` to download new bill metadata and text.

The celery task is running daily at midnight in the server background.

Whenever celery task started running, it creates `UscongressUpdateJob` table record in the database to track the task status.

The fields in the `UscongressUpdateJob`:

- job_id : celery task id

- fdsys_status : choice field (pending, success, failed) : It represents the status of uscongress bill download (fdsys and text versions) what the celery task `update_bill_task` does. Once it's finished, the field value turns to `success` or `failed`

- saved : the list of bill congress numbers downloaded by running the celery task `update_bill_task`.

- skips : the list of bill congress numbers skipped by running the celery task `update_bill_task`.

- data_status : choice field (pending, success, failed) : Once download is finished, the celery task `update_bill_task` creates `data.json` out of `data.xml` and text_versions that is exactly same as the `./run bills` does.

- bill_status : choice field (pending, success, failed) : After creating `data.json`, we creates `billList.json` and `billsMeta.json` by running another celery task named `bill_data_task`. the field represents the status of the celery task to see if it's finished (succeed or failed)

- meta_status : choice field (pending, success, failed) : After creating `billList.json` and `billsMeta.json`, we process the metadata by running the celery task named `process_bill_meta_task`. It represents the status of the task to see if it's finished or in pending.

- related_status : choice field (pending, success, failed) : Once the celery task `process_bill_meta_task` is finished, the other celery task named `related_bill_task` to get related bills. This field represents the status of the celery task.

- elastic_status : choice field (pending, success, failed) : Once the task `related_bill_task` is finished, the other celery task named `elastic_load_task` runs in order to update loading of the `new` bills into Elasticsearch. This field represents the status of the task.

- similarity :  choice field (pending, success, failed) : After finishing `elastic_load_task`, we update `es_similarity` field of each bill in the database. This is the field of the task status.

- created : the date time field represents the time when the record is created. 

+
2. Create `billList.json` and `billsMeta.json`

Once the celery task `update_bill_task` is finished (complete the download bill text and metadata), the other celery task named `bill_data_task` runs. This is triggered in the `save` function of the `uscongress.models.py`:

```python
 def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
        if self.pk and self.data_status == self.SUCCESS and self.bill_status == self.PENDING:
            current_app.send_task(
                'uscongress.tasks.bill_data_task',
                args=(self.pk, ),
                queue='bill'
            )
        if self.pk and self.bill_status == self.SUCCESS and self.meta_status == self.PENDING:
            current_app.send_task(
                'uscongress.tasks.process_bill_meta_task',
                args=(self.pk, ),
                queue='bill'
            )
			...
```

As mentioned above, whenever the `update_bill_task` runs, it creates `UscongressUpdateJob` table record in the database.

In `saved` fields, there is the list of bill congress number that represents which bills are newly downloaded.

The task `bill_data_task` creates billList.json and `billsMeta.json` file with the list in `saved` field and dump related bill json files.

data.json files at the top level (not the data.json in the text versions) are used to create metadata.

We will provide an option, which will be the default, to get bill XML from the directory structure that is created by uscongress open source scraper. (In other case, flat structure could be used to get bill XML)

3. Process bill meta data.

After completing `bill_data_task`, `process_bill_meta_task` runs. This processes and organizes the metadata for bills.

4. Create Related bills.

Next, the `related_bill_task` runs.

In the task it creates bill instances in the Bill table in the database.

5. Update loading of the `new` bills into Elasticsearch

The celery task `elastic_load_task` update loading of the `new` bills into Elasticsearch

The xml for bill similarity is in text_versions that is the bill document itself.

We use them.

6. Update the bill similarity

The celery task `bill_similarity_task` update the bill similarity.

It only update the new bills since the new bill list is in the `saved` field in the UscongressUpdateJob table record.

The xml for bill similarity is in text_versions that is the bill document itself, so we use them.

### Statements of Administration Policy 

Found in `server_py/flatgov/common/management`, the Statements of Administration Policy task (currently 'biden_statements.py') scrapes the links of SAP from the White House website and stores to the database using the `original_pdf_link` as a unique field to avoid duplicates.

### Committee Reports 

TODO: describe the celery task for committee reports 

### CBO Scores

The CBO Scores task (in `common/tasks.py`, referring to `common/cbo.py`) processes metadata from bill status XML, to retrieve the 'cboCostEstimates' field. Once all of these are collected, it checks the database for each entry and stores any new entries.

### CRS Reports

The CRS Reports task runs the CRS scraper, described in xref:CRS_REPORTS.adoc[CRS_REPORTS].

## Celery installation and set-up 

### Celery Schedule

The Celery tasks are run on a schedule by `celery-beat`. The schedule is defined in https://github.com/aih/FlatGov/blob/main/server_py/flatgov/flatgov/celery.py

For example, a CSV of the CRS documents is created every night at midnight here:

https://github.com/aih/FlatGov/blob/main/server_py/flatgov/flatgov/celery.py#L42

```
'crs_scraper_daily': {
'task': 'bills.tasks.crs_task',
'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour=1),
'options': {'queue': 'bill'}
},
```

### How to run a celery task

#### Development

For a celery worker, open one terminal, go to the Django project root directory (in our case `.../Flatgov/server_py/flatgov`), then activate the virtual environment.

Run the command below (Run the celery worker).

`celery worker -Q bill -A flatgov.celery:app -n flatgov.%%h --loglevel=info`

For celery scheduler, open another terminal, go to the Django project root directory (in our case `.../Flatgov/server_py/flatgov`), then activate the virtual environment.

Run the command below (Run the celery redbeat)

`celery beat -S redbeat.RedBeatScheduler -A flatgov.celery:app --loglevel=info`

Then the background tasks (celery tasks ) run daily at midnight.


#### Production: Run Celeryd as a daemon on the Ubuntu server

1. Init-script: celeryd

Before configuring it, go to the `deployment_scripts/conf_celeryd` and update all the paths with the absolute paths

Copy `deployment_scripts/bill_celeryd` file to `/etc/init.d/celeryd`.

Make celeryd executable (Run following commands from the terminal.)

`sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/celeryd`

`sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/celeryd`

For configuration, copy `deployment_scripts/conf_celeryd` file to `/etc/default/celeryd`.

You can check if the worker is active by:

```bash
(flatgov) ubuntu:/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov/flatgov$  sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/run/celery/
(flatgov) ubuntu/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov/flatgov$ sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/log/celery/
(flatgov) ubuntu:/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov/flatgov$ sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start
celery init v10.1.
Using config script: /etc/default/celeryd
celery multi v4.4.2 (cliffs)
> Starting nodes...
	> celery@ip-172-31-58-205: OK
```


NOTE: On Ubuntu, using the default `ubuntu` user, the settings are as follows.

```bash
CELERY_BIN="/home/ubuntu/.pyenv/versions/flatgov/bin/celery"
CELERY_APP="flatgov.celery:app"

CELERYD_CHDIR="/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov/"
CELERYD_OPTS="--time-limit=300 --concurrency=3 -Q bill -l INFO"
CELERYD_LOG_FILE="/var/log/celery/link_%n%I.log"
CELERYD_PID_FILE="/var/run/celery/link_%n.pid"
CELERYD_USER="ubuntu"
CELERYD_GROUP="ubuntu"
CELERY_CREATE_DIRS=1
```

To test:
```bash
(flatgov) ubuntu:/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov/flatgov$ sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd status
celery init v10.1.
Using config script: /etc/default/celeryd
celeryd (node link_celery) (pid 26679) is up...
```

+
2. Init-script: celerybeat

Before configuring it, go to the `deployment_scripts/conf_celerybeat` and update all the paths with the absolute paths

Copy `deployment_scripts/celerybeat` file to `/etc/init.d/celerybeat`.

Make celerybeat executable (Run following commands from the terminal.)

`sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/celerybeat`

`sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/celerybeat`

For configuration, copy `deployment_scripts/conf_celerybeat` file to `/etc/default/celerybeat`.

Then 
`sudo chown root:root '/etc/default/celerybeat'`
`sudo chmod 640 '/etc/default/celerybeat'`

You can check if the beat is active by:

`sudo /etc/init.d/celerybeat start`

`sudo /etc/init.d/celerybeat status`

On ubuntu, with a 'flatgov' virtualenv, the settings are as follows:

"/etc/default/celerybeat" 
```
CELERY_BIN="/home/ubuntu/.pyenv/versions/3.8.3/envs/flatgov/bin/celery"
CELERY_APP="flatgov.celery:app"
CELERYBEAT_CHDIR="/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov"
CELERYBEAT_USER="ubuntu"
CELERYBEAT_GROUP="ubuntu"
CELERYBEAT_OPTS="--schedule=/var/run/celery/celerybeat-schedule"
```

+
3. Maintenance

As was shown, the following commands control worker and beat:

`/etc/init.d/celeryd {start|stop|restart}`

`/etc/init.d/celerybeat {start|stop|restart}`

The celerybeat user may also need to be set to `ubuntu`

+
4. Run a task manually

If you need to run a task manually (e.g. to test, or to get data off schedule), run a separate Celery worker:

```bash
(flatgov) ubuntu:/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov$ celery worker -Q bill -A flatgov.celery:app -n flatgov.%%h --loglevel=info

 -------------- celery@flatgov.%ip-... v4.4.2 (cliffs)
--- ***** -----
-- ******* ---- Linux-5.4.0-1041-aws-x86_64-with-glibc2.27 2021-04-01 18:18:04
- *** --- * ---
- ** ---------- [config]
```

Then in a separate terminal run `pyenv activate flatgov`. Then:

```python
(flatgov) ubuntu:/opt/flatgov/FlatGov/server_py/flatgov$ python manage.py shell
Python 3.8.3 (default, Sep 24 2020, 22:52:34)
[GCC 7.5.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> from bills.tasks import sap_scrapy_task
>>> from celery import current_app
>>> current_app.send_task('bills.tasks.sap_scrapy_task', queue='bill')
<AsyncResult: a5d7d336-0125-4bdf-8819-5628b2341081>
```
OR for the uscongress update task:
```
>>> from uscongress.tasks import update_bill_task
>>> from celery import current_app
>>> current_app.send_task('uscongress.tasks.update_bill_task', queue='bill')
<AsyncResult: f05d3449-d473-498f-b6f0-87f663cd20e3>
```

Then you can track the task by looking in the celery logs, or on the original celery terminal, e.g.:
```

```


For a different task, e.g. CommitteeDocument, the commands are:
`celery worker -Q bill -A flatgov.celery:app -n flatgov.%%h --loglevel=info`

- Open another shell and run django shell -> 
```bash
python manage.py shell
from celery import current_app
current_app.send_task("bills.tasks.committee_report_scrapy_task", queue="bill")
```

See image::media/celery-task-manual.png[Manual Celery Task,300,200]

Then you can keep track of the task status on the terminal that celery is running on or you can see the CommitteeDocument records in the django admin dashboard.
The initial data loading will take a long time; there are about 17,000 records.

### Redis: install and start

Running Celery requires Redis. To set up and get Redis working see below. Also see the instructions on the [Redis website](https://redis.io/).:

* On Ubuntu:

Install
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install redis-server
Reading package lists... Done
Fetched 634 kB in 0s (24.3 MB/s)...

```


Start
`sudo systemctl restart redis.service`


To confirm that it is running:
`sudo systemctl status redis`

If necessary, edit `/etc/redis/redis.conf`. Our set-up should not require any special settings
